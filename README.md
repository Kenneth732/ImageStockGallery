# Photo Shop
# Filter and Render User Data
```
This project consists of a JavaScript file that filters and renders user data from an API endpoint based on user input.
```
# How it works
```
When the page loads, it calls handleRenderUsers(), which fetches all user data and renders it on the page.
```
When the user types into the input field and clicks the submit button, the handleFilter() function is called. It fetches user data with the provided query string and filters the results to only include users whose names match the query (case-insensitive). It then renders the filtered user data on the page.

# Dependencies
```
This project has no external dependencies.
```
# Installation and Usage
```
To use this project, simply include the script.js file in your HTML file using a <script> tag.
```
The handleRenderUsers() function will be called automatically when the page loads, and the filter functionality will be enabled when the user enters text into the input field and clicks the submit button.
